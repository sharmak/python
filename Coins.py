Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and 
we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins,
how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, 
there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. 
So output should be 4. 
For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, 
there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} 
and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.

To understand this, we need handle two cases:
 a) Exclude Nth value
 b) Include Nth value
